# HeartDisease_prediction
## Project Description
In this project I used **Scikit Learn** package to create a model that predicts whether an individual is at risk of *Heart Disease*
or not.
### Python libraries used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Math
### Steps followed.
In summary here are the steps I followed in coming up with the model:
- Loaded the csv file using **Pandas**
- Checked for missing values and outliers.
- Separated the features fromt the outcome.
- Split the train and test data.
- Performed feature scaling using the **StandardScaler**
- Performed feature selection, where I chose to use 9 features.
- Defined and trained the **KNeighborsClassifier** model.
- Made predictions on the test data.
- Generates the **accuracy score**, **confusion matrix** and **f1 value score**
